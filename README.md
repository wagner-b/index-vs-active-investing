# Index Investing vs Active Investing

The goal of this project is to create a computer algorithm to manage an active investing portfolio (based on stock picking and market timing), and compare its returns against those of the S&P 500 index, from 2007 to 2022.

Please, keep in mind I am not considering any fees or taxes that may be applicable in real life, since there is too much variation depending on where you live and what services you use. 

And also please remember there is NO investment advice or financial advice 
of any kind here. This is only educational content. I am NOT a financial advisor, and I take 
NO responsibility over the consequences of any investing decision you take.
